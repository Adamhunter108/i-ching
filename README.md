Consult the Book of Changes.

Take 3 ordinary coins as similar as possible.  Think about a question that you would like guidance with.  Toss all 3 coins at the same time and input whether they come up heads or tails.  Do this 6 times and a hexagram will be constructed.  The hexagram will reveal what you are seeking.
