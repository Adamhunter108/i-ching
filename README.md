Consult the Book of Changes.

###### What is I Ching:
I Ching, usually translated to 'book of changes' is an ancient Chinese divination text that provides guidence for moral decision making as informed by Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. 


###### How to consult the Book of Changes:
Take 3 ordinary coins as similar as possible, think about a question that you would like guidance with and toss all 3 coins at the same time and input whether they come up heads or tails.  Do this 6 times and a hexagram will be constructed.  There are 64 unique hexagrams and each one has a value that can be independently researched and studied further (Google your hex value for more information).

###### About Project:
This command line program, built in Python, gives you the option to manually input the results of your coin tosses or will automatically provide you with a random result.  

Note: Some versions of the I Ching will require additional tosses due to changing lines and mutating hexagrams, this program takes those nuances into account and only provides the user with their final hexagram.
